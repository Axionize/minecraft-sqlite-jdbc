# SQLite JDBC for Fabric and Forge

SQLite JDBC driver for use as an external library/optional dependency by other projects.

* This mod doesn't do anything by itself - but it can be used by other mods that use JDBC, like [Dynmap](https://github.com/webbukkit/dynmap).
* This mod is a direct repackage of the [Xerial SQLite JDBC Driver](https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc) with added mod metadata to allow it to be loaded on Fabric and Forge.
* There are no modifications to the underlying JDBC driver.

This mod is an universal JAR and should work on all Fabric and Forge versions.
